# Tooling

## dromonctl

Alongside Dromon, there is a command-line tool called dromonctl which can be used to control a running Dromon instance. Currently the functionality of dromonctl isn't specific to Dromon itself so it can also be used together with other FHIRÂ® servers.

Dromonctl is most suitable to upload transaction bundles to Dromon.

Download of the latest release: [dromonctl v0.2.0](https://github.com/samply/dromonctl/releases/tag/v0.2.0)

## Synthea Patient Generator
